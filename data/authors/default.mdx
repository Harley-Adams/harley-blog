Architecting and delivering robust, large-scale distributed systems for
Microsoft's premier gaming cloud platforms, Xbox Network and PlayFab. Leading
the design and evolution of core services like Achievements, Leaderboards,
Statistics and MinutesPlayed. Ensuring resilience and performance at global
scale. I'm also pretty sure I'm my team's personality hire, so take all this
with a large silo of salt.

## Why write a blog?

I've found myself in a pretty sweet gig where I get to interact and work with awesome game developers making awesome games. In this role, I focus on scaling features and services for games of all shapes and sizes. However, I can't scale one-on-one communication to as many developers as I'd like and still have time to get actual work done!

My goal with this blog is to practice (and improve!) my technical writing skills so I can better engage with more cool game devs. I get to work on (and ideally solve) a lot of interesting problems, and where it's not company confidential, I'd like to share back with the software engineering community that I've learned so much from myself. I also want to include some jokes, but if you couldn't tell, well, forget I said anything.

I hope you'll find these posts insightful, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!
