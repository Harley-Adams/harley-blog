summary: A case study on how we load test PlayFab leaderboards.

A case study in load testing to validate your new service. At PlayFab we recently launched our [new Leaderboards offering](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/leverage-new-features-with-playfab-leaderboards/). Before any games released utilizing the service, we load tested the product.
