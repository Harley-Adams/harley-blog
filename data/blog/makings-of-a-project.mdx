summary: High level overview of what you have to cover as a Tech Lead on a project.
---

## Feature exploration

- Competitive analysis
- Similar usage in games
- What would increase your engagement or fun as a player
- What would make your life easier as a developer

## Defining Business Value

- Convincing leadership that you should do the project

# Architecture design

- What are your dependencies
- What are the write flows, data in to the service
- What are the read flows, data out of the service
- Access patterns
- What azure technologies best fulfill your read/write flows
	- large sorted or searchable dataset? consider redis
	- permanent storage with actions after write? consider cosmosdb and changefeeds
	- live connections between clients? consider signalr
- How does it scale? What are the limitations and bottlenecks?
- How is data partitioned or sharded
- Where and what are you going to cache to improve latency/reduce cost

# Cost analysis 

$1 per month for free title seems to be a good starting point. This is roughly where we landed for leaderboards (TODO: see what free tier costs ).

- CosmosDb storage
- Read and Write RU cost per request
- Expected rps for system 
- Entity level throttling limits
- What are the free limits
- Which features are paid only
- define billing meters and cost (cogs not price)

# Dev plan

- Phased approach
	- Work broken down into chunks 
	- Dev time estimate
	- Deliver value in chunks (sooner)
- Define milestones. Release goals
- Track dependencies on partners.
	- SDK integrations
	- Client implementations (Xbox apps/shell)
	- Marketing/Blog posts

# Test/Validation plan

- Define what integration and E2E tests should cover
- Ensure feature and customer scenarios have matching Integration and E2E tests 

# Delivery plan

- Split work into deliverables
- Align deliverables to a delivery plan in ADO
	- Recommend max of 1 deliverable per developer resource at a time
- Pick dates for milestones. Private Preview, Public Preview, General Availability

# Cost, billing and revenue

- Establish a price for each meter
- What are the free limits
- Decide which features are in the free tier

# Load testing

- Azure Load Testing
- locust (python based load testing framework)

# Compliance and security checklist

- Go through OneCS
